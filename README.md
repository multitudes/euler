# The Euler Project In a Swift Package

The first 100 challenges done in Swift.

## How to use it

You might need to be on a mac, but it could work on a Linux system with some changes, I did not try.
Once you download the package open it in Xcode clicking on the `Package.Swift` file, or from the terminal:

```bash
cd euler 
# the challenge number is mandatory, the [-s] is optional and will show the solution if entered 
swift run euler <challenge number> [-s]
```

This is thought as an educational project to complete the first 100 days of Euler. The solutions are not provided.
It is meant as a practice repo to store your solutions and become a better coder.

Every challenge has a folder with the challenge+number as a class. Edit that folder and the class to run your challenges

Happy coding! 

<!-- I will add my solution in different branches, so the master branch will be always 'blank' like a canvas.
