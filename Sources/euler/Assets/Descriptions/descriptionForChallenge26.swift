\nProject Euler Problem 26: Reciprocal cyclesA unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:\n
\n
Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
